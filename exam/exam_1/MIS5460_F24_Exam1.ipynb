    "## Problem 1 (25 points)\n",
    "As a Data Analyst in a newly established brewery, your objective is to extract insights from a dataset containing beer profiles and ratings. The goal is to identify significant features, both numerical and categorical, that play crucial roles in predicting two key aspects: the beer style (Style) and the overall review rating (review_overall). To achieve this, you are required to preprocess the data effectively and compile a refined list of features that are important for predictive modeling. Preprocessing may involve handling missing values, detecting and addressing outliers, defining new features, transforming categorical (text) data into numerical using dummy variables or other encoding methods, and performing data transformations such as scaling. Additionally, feature selection methods like removing multicollinear variables or using dimensionality reduction techniques should be employed to improve model performance as you see fit. What features do you want to use and why?"
