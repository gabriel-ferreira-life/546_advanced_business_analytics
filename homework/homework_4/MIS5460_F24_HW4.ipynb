    "2. **Submission:** Submit both your IPython notebook (.ipynb) and an HTML file of the notebook to Canvas under Assignments → HW # → Submit Assignment. After submitting, download and check the files to make sure that you've uploaded the correct versions. Both files are required for your HW to be graded.\n",

    " <font color='red'> No pdf file required so write all the details in your ipynb file.</font>\n",
    "2. **AI Use Policy:** Solve each problem independently by yourself. Use AI tools like ChatGPT or Google Gemini for brainstorming and learning only—copying AI-generated content is prohibited. You do not neeViolations will lead to penalties, up to failing the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Problem Structure:** <font color='red'>Break down each problem ( already done in most problems) into three interconnected parts and implement each in separate code cells. Ensure that each part logically builds on the previous one. Include comments in your code to explain its purpose, followed by a Markdown cell analyzing what was achieved. After completing all parts, add a final Markdown cell reflecting on your overall approach, discussing any challenges faced, and explaining how you utilized AI tools in your process.\n",

Do not share or post course materials without the express written consent of the copyright holder and instructor. The class will follow Iowa State University’s policy on academic dishonesty.
